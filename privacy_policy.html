        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 7, 2026</p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>Your Privacy is Protected</h3>
            <p>Ditto does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All processing happens entirely on your
                device.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>Ditto does not collect any data from its users. We have designed our app with privacy as a core principle.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No personal information is collected</li>
            <li>No usage analytics or tracking</li>
            <li>No data is sent to external servers</li>
            <li>No third-party services have access to your data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>On-Device Processing</h2>
        <p>All data processing within Ditto occurs entirely on your device. Your photo metadata stays on your device and
            is never transmitted elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The app only reads and writes photo metadata using Apple's Photos framework with your explicit permission.
            This data is processed locally and is never stored outside of the standard system frameworks.</p>

        <h2>Apple Photos</h2>
        <p>Ditto integrates with Apple Photos to access and modify photo metadata. This integration is governed by
            Apple's strict privacy guidelines:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You control which photos the app can access</li>
            <li>Photos data is encrypted and protected by iOS/iPadOS/macOS</li>
            <li>We only read and write metadata; we never export or share your photos</li>
            <li>Access can be revoked at any time in Settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an
            updated revision date. Our commitment to not collecting user data will remain unchanged.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, <a href="support.html">please contact us</a>.</p>
